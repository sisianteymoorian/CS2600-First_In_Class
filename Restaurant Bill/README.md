Assignment: first_in_class
For Wrtint this program, first I am asking user to enter the cost of the meal from the four given meals. Second, I asked the user to enter the percentage of the tax
and then I asked the user to enter the percentage of the tip. I used tax_amount and tip_amount to calculate the amount of the tax and tip based on the cost of the 
meal and the percentage of tax and tip. 
Calculation: percentage of tax / 100 = result 
             result * the cost of the meal
I did the same calculation for tip.
Caculating the total amount which shows on bill: cost of the meal + tax_amount + tax_tip.
