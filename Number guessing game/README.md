I created a menu with 3 options, then asked user to enter an option. 
Using rand(), for choosing random number. I used do loop for option 1 and 2. For first two option max value is 10 but in the second option, I told the user max value, but in first option, I did not tell
the user about the max value. I add if statements, if entered number is lower than random number, if higher than random number, of if equal to random number then w
win the game. 
If user entered q, the game will be ended.
